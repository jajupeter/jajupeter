## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hi, Iâ€™m a Research-Oriented Data & Machine Learning Scientist with a background in Computer Engineering. I specialize in turning cutting-edge research into scalable, data-driven solutions that solve real-world problems across industries. My work sits at the intersection of AI innovation, data science, and applied machine learning, with a strong focus on ethical and explainable AI. Iâ€™m also a certified AWS AI Practitioner and IBM AI AI practitioner.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on translating academic research into deployable products for enterprise and public sector impact
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced topics in Generative AI (LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cross-disciplinary AI/ML research projects (health, education, smart cities)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Fine-tuning domain-specific LLMs
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about building end-to-end machine learning systems
- ðŸ“« Portfolio and how to reach me: <a href="https://jajupeter.github.io/opeyemiojajuni/index.html" target="new">opeyemiojajuni</a> 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: When Iâ€™m not building models or debugging pipelines, youâ€™ll find me experimenting with VR simulations or mapping out AI-powered smart cities!
